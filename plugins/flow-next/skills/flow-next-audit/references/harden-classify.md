# Harden classification (gated reference)

## Harden

**Meaning:** the entry is correct, keeps getting re-learned, and states a rule a machine can check. Graduate it into an enforced gate (lint rule / CI step / instruction-file rule) and demote the entry to a pointer at that gate — the file stays on disk, body intact. The lesson stops riding the context window on every run and starts firing automatically — for every agent and every human, in every harness.

An entry that is re-injected each run and re-taught each time is the anti-pattern: the agent re-fixes the same class instead of the class being impossible. Harden closes that loop.

**Two conditions, both required (AND):**

**(1) Recurrence signal.** Inferred from **write-side artifacts plus LLM judgment, never a usage count** — flow-next has no read-side telemetry: `memory-scout` retrieval and worker re-anchor reads leave zero trace, and nothing records "this entry fired during a run." Cite the artifacts in evidence bullets, never a count of uses. An entry (or cluster) becomes a **candidate** when ANY primary signal fires:

- **`>= 2` `## Update` headings** on the entry — the lesson was explicitly re-taught at least twice.
- **`>= 4` substantive commits** touching the entry file — sustained write churn on one lesson. Audit-bookkeeping commits and pure renames are not re-teachings and do not count.

`related_to` cluster size is a **corroborating signal only**: a cluster of `>= 3` raises a candidate ONLY when it co-occurs with at least one `## Update` heading somewhere in the cluster, or with the commit signal on any member. **On its own it proposes nothing.**

The scan that produces these numbers — the rename-following `git log`, the bookkeeping filter and why it exists, the cluster aggregates — lives in [workflow.md](../workflow.md) §0.75.1 and runs before the auto-Keep decision.

> **Why these thresholds.** On a real store, the `## Update` signal matches about 4% of entries and the commit signal about 5%; the bookkeeping filter holds the commit rate steady as audits accumulate. A standalone `related_to >= 3` trigger would match about **28%**. `related_to` is auto-populated by overlap scoring on every `memory add`, so cluster size measures topic collision, not re-teaching — left standalone it would flag more than a quarter of the store on the first run and train the user to decline Harden reflexively. The two primary signals are selective and match the recurring-pain intuition, so they keep their values.

Thresholds gate **proposing** only; the human gates **applying**. They are overridable by judgment in either direction — state the evidence when you override (e.g. a single-`## Update` entry that names a rule the linter already almost covers is worth proposing; four commits that were all typo fixes are not recurrence).

**(2) Mechanizability.** The lesson must be expressible as a deterministic check a gate can run — always LLM-judged, never inferred from the counts. "Never use naive `datetime.now()`" is mechanizable. "Prefer composition over inheritance when the hierarchy gets awkward" is not.

**When to use:**

- Both conditions hold: a recurrence signal fires AND the lesson is a deterministic, checkable rule.
- The rule can land in a gate surface that **already exists** in this repo (see Gate targets below).
- No existing, active gate already enforces the class (see Duplication guard).

**When NOT to use:**

- The lesson is wrong, misleading, or its code is gone → Replace / Delete win outright (precedence). Never graduate a wrong lesson.
- The entry is one of several overlapping entries → Consolidate first; the merged entry is the Harden unit.
- One-off lesson, no recurrence signal → Keep.
- Judgment-only lesson ("prefer X style when ambiguous", "escalate when the review disagrees") → not Harden. A gate that cannot decide mechanically becomes a false-positive generator. With a recurrence signal **and a nameable retrieval defect** the entry is an Update (retrieval-fix variant); with recurrence but no nameable defect — as without recurrence at all — it falls through to the ordinary reference-drift check, so Keep absent drift of its own. Recurrence alone never licenses a metadata edit: §0.75.1's counters never decrease, so an ungated branch re-fires on the same entry every run.
- The repo has no surface to host the gate — see the degradation rule below; the instruction file is the universal floor, and if even that does not exist, Keep.
- **Autofix mode.** Harden never auto-applies. Candidates are reported under Recommended only — no artifact write, no demotion. Gate surfaces are shared repo infrastructure; an autonomous sweep must not edit lint config, CI, or CLAUDE.md unattended.

**Gate targets — cheapest-fitting first, discovered from repo files, never assumed and never scaffolded:**

- **(a) Lint rule** — extend the repo's existing linter config (ruff, biome, eslint, … — discovered by reading the repo, not assumed from the language). No linter configured → unavailable, fall through.
- **(b) CI step** — a check in the repo's existing CI workflow (e.g. under `.github/workflows/`). No CI → unavailable, fall through.
- **(c) Instruction-file rule** — a one-to-two-line rule appended to the **substantive** CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md (the one that is not just an `@`-include shim — the same "which file is real" discovery as [workflow.md](../workflow.md) Phase 6). This is the **universal floor** and the degradation target for review-shaped lessons, since a first-class review-checklist gate type is deliberately out of v1 (no canonical checklist artifact exists to write into).

**Never scaffold infrastructure to host a gate.** Do not create a linter setup, a CI pipeline, or a config file that does not already exist. The gate lands in what the repo already has, or it degrades to (c), or the entry stays Keep.

**Duplication guard (run BEFORE proposing):** grep the candidate gate surfaces (linter config, CI workflows, instruction files) for a rule already covering the class.

- **Matched AND active** (confirmed by the same activeness check as gate verification — [workflow.md](../workflow.md) §4.7 step 2) → the class is already enforced. Propose **pointer-demotion only**: no new artifact, `mark-hardened` citing the *existing* gate as `--gate-ref`.
- **Matched but inactive** (commented out, sitting in an `ignore` list, in a config the tool does not read, in a disabled or unreferenced CI job) → this is **not** a duplicate, it is a broken gate. The entry **stays `active`**, nothing is demoted, and the finding is reported so a human can fix the gate.
- **No match** → proceed with a new artifact.

A textual hit is never sufficient evidence of enforcement.

**Execution.** The procedure is [workflow.md](../workflow.md) §4.7 (interactive only): write the accepted draft, **verify the gate actually fires**, then demote via `flowctl memory mark-hardened` with a `<path>#<rule-id> -- <note>` gate-ref. Three rules from it are decision-shaping, so know them before you propose:

- **Verification is a hard precondition of demotion.** Writing config is not enforcing a rule, and a gate that does not fire is strictly worse than no gate: it retires the only working copy of the lesson while enforcing nothing. Verification failure → the entry stays `active`, `mark-hardened` is NOT called, and the run reports a failed graduation.
- **`<rule-id>` must be a literal substring of the artifact**, not a locator expression — the next run's gate-liveness check greps for it verbatim.
- **Never `git rm` on Harden**, on any track. The entry becomes a pointer so "why does this rule exist?" stays answerable forever.

**Already-hardened entries on later runs** are never dropped silently and never re-investigated: they get the cheap gate-liveness check in [workflow.md](../workflow.md) §0.75.2 (gate live → still-hardened; gate gone or inactive → propose un-graduation via `mark-fresh`; gate upgraded → re-`mark-hardened` with the new ref).

**Edge cases:**

- **Cluster candidates** — the cluster, not each member, is the Harden unit. Consolidate first (precedence), then evaluate the merged entry once. Never write one gate per member.
- **Decision-track entries** (`knowledge/decisions/`) — legal and **rare**; most decisions are judgment records, not mechanizable checks. See [decision-entries.md](decision-entries.md).
- **Stale entries** — `stale → hardened` is legal. A lesson can be stale as written and still name a real, mechanizable class; `mark-hardened` clears `stale_reason` / `stale_date` as part of the flip. Do not force a `mark-fresh` round trip first.
- **Non-code repos** (docs sites, an Obsidian vault) — targets (a)/(b) are simply unavailable; (c) is the floor.
- **First post-ship run** — recurrence signals are derived retroactively, so the first ordinary audit after this ships may surface several candidates at once. That is intended: the thresholds above are what keeps the volume sane, and there is no first-run suppression or rate limit.
- **Legacy flat files** — skipped as always; migrate first.

## Phase 2 Harden gate

**A Harden classification rests on two independent conditions.** A Harden proposed on one of them alone has broken this: it needs both a recurrence signal from §0.75.1 (`>= 2` `## Update` headings or `>= 4` entry-file commits; `related_to >= 3` corroborates only) and an LLM judgment that the lesson is mechanizable. Missing recurrence → Keep. **Recurrence present but not mechanizable → Update (retrieval fix), when the retrieval surface is actually deficient:** the lesson was re-learned while a correct entry sat in the store, so the defect is in how the entry is found, not what it says. Name the defect first — the field or fields (`title`, `tags`, `module`, `applies_when`, placement) that would miss the query this lesson's topic gets searched by. **No nameable defect → no retrieval fix**, recurrence notwithstanding (the entry falls through to the ordinary reference-drift check, so Keep unless it has drift of its own): the recurrence counters are all-history and never decrease, and a retrieval repair is itself a substantive commit in the §0.75.1 scan, so a branch that fired on recurrence alone would re-fire on every later audit forever and churn a repaired entry's metadata once per run in autofix. Evidence bullets cite the write-side artifacts (the `## Update` headings, the entry-file commits), never a usage count; the fix is scoped by [phases.md](../phases.md) §Update, retrieval-fix variant. The duplication guard runs before the candidate reaches Phase 3: an already-enforced-and-active class becomes a pointer-demotion proposal with no new artifact; a matched-but-inactive rule is a broken gate, so the entry stays `active` and the finding is reported. **In autofix mode, Harden candidates are never applied** — they are classified and reported under Recommended only.
