# Flow-Next Setup (Optional)

Wire this repo to the plugin: the versioned docs snippet plus flow-next configuration. **Fully optional** - flow-next works without this via the plugin.

## Benefits

- Other AI agents (Codex, Cursor, etc.) can read instructions from CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md

## Workflow

Read [workflow.md](workflow.md) and follow each step in order.

## Notes

- **Fully optional** - standard plugin usage works without local setup
- Copies nothing into the repo - plugin updates need no per-repo re-run, on any host
- Safe to re-run - needed only when the snippet schema bumps or configuration/seeds change
