# Flow plan

Turn an idea or an existing spec into a spec with right-sized tasks in `.flow/`, grounded in repo research. Plan writes no code.

Read [working-rules.md](../../references/working-rules.md) first; it holds for every step of this skill.

**`.flow/` is the only task tracker.** Every spec and task is created or changed through `flowctl`. A markdown TODO list, a TodoWrite call, or a plan file outside `.flow/` has broken this.

## Preamble

**flowctl is bundled, not installed globally** (`which flowctl` fails). Define it once; later blocks here and in `steps.md` use `$FLOWCTL`:

```bash
FLOWCTL="${DROID_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}}/scripts/flowctl"
[ -x "$FLOWCTL" ] || FLOWCTL="<plugin-root>/scripts/flowctl"   # <plugin-root> = the directory two levels above this skill's SKILL.md file (the harness gave you that file's absolute path when the skill loaded); substitute it literally
[ -x "$FLOWCTL" ] || FLOWCTL=".flow/bin/flowctl"
```

Check once for flowctl copies left by an older install layout:

```bash
LEFTOVERS=""
for p in .flow/bin/flowctl .flow/bin/flowctl.cmd .flow/bin/flowctl.py \
         .flow/bin/flowctl_bootstrap.py .flow/bin/flowctl-help.txt \
         .flow/bin/flowctl_tracker .flow/templates/spec.md .flow/usage.md; do
  [ -e "$p" ] && LEFTOVERS="${LEFTOVERS}${p}"$'\n' || true
done   # || true: an empty LEFTOVERS (the normal case) must read as success
```

None present: say nothing. Any present: print one line saying nothing reads them and they can be deleted by hand or by `/flow-next:setup`, then continue. Never ask, stop, or delete here.

## No implementation code

The spec states what and why as contracts; each task states how: named files, the repo pattern to follow (`file:line`), ordering, and non-obvious gotchas. Code in a plan is limited to signatures and interfaces, pointers to existing patterns, a recent or surprising API from docs-scout, and a gotcha from practice-scout. A full function or module body, or a copy-paste block over about 10 lines, has broken this: implementation happens in `/flow-next:work` with fresh context, and code written here is paid for again there and drifts.

## Input

Full request: $ARGUMENTS

Accepts a freeform idea; a spec id `fn-N-slug` (legacy `fn-N`, `fn-N-xxx`); a task id `fn-N-slug.M` (legacy `fn-N.M`, `fn-N-xxx.M`); a tracker handle such as `wor-17` that `flowctl show` resolves (always the existing spec or task, never a new idea; see Step 1); and chained instructions such as "then review with /flow-next:plan-review".

Empty input: ask "What should I plan? Give me the feature or bug in 1-5 sentences." Under autonomy, report `NEEDS_HUMAN: no planning input provided` and stop.

A ready or captured spec is plan input. An unshaped, oversized idea with several consequential unknowns is not: recommend `/flow-next:chart` (or `/flow-next:flow --explain` when unsure) and stop. Plan decomposes understood work; it does not replace discovery.

## Options

**Autonomy.** The literal token `mode:autonomous` in `$ARGUMENTS` (strip it) or `FLOW_AUTONOMOUS=1` sets `AUTONOMOUS=1`. Then no question is ever asked: explicit flags win, and anything unset takes its default (depth below, research `repo-scout`, review the configured backend, `none` when it is `ASK`). A genuinely unanswerable ambiguity stops with a one-line `NEEDS_HUMAN: <reason>`.

**Depth.** `--depth=short` ("quick", "minimal"), `--depth=standard` ("normal"), `--depth=deep` ("comprehensive", "detailed"). Default SHORT. Depth picks the scout set (Step 1) and the spec sections (Step 4).

**Research.** Always `repo-scout`; `--research=grep` is a no-op and any other value is ignored.

**Review.** `--review=codex` ("review with codex", "codex review", "use codex"), `--review=rp` ("rp chat", "repoprompt review"), `--review=host` ("host review", "use host": the host-native fresh-context reviewer), `--review=export` ("export review", "external llm"), `--review=none` or `--no-review` ("no review", "skip review").

An option found in the arguments, as a flag or in these words, skips its setup question.

Initialize and capture one preflight snapshot before routing or scouting (also under autonomy). Every later config read uses this literal path:

```bash
$FLOWCTL init --json
PLAN_CFG="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/flow-plan-config-<suffix>.json"
$FLOWCTL preflight --json > "$PLAN_CFG" 2>/dev/null || printf '{"key":null,"value":{}}' > "$PLAN_CFG"
```

```bash
ACTIVE=0
# No pipelines in the probe: capture raw first, rc-checked; parse separately.
RAW="$(jq -er 'if .probes.review_backend.status == "ok" then .probes.review_backend.value.backend else error("review backend probe") end' "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/flow-plan-config-<suffix>.json" 2>/dev/null)" || ACTIVE=1        # probe error => ACTIVE
if [ "$ACTIVE" = "0" ]; then
  REVIEW_BACKEND="$(printf '%s' "$RAW" | tr -d '[:space:]' 2>/dev/null)" || ACTIVE=1   # parse error => ACTIVE
  [ "$REVIEW_BACKEND" = "ASK" ] && ACTIVE=1
fi
[ "${AUTONOMOUS:-0}" = "1" ] && ACTIVE=0        # autonomous never asks
if [ "$ACTIVE" = "1" ]; then
  echo "SETUP-QUESTIONS GATE ACTIVE — STOP. Read references/setup-questions.md before continuing."
fi
```

When the sentinel prints, read [`references/setup-questions.md`](references/setup-questions.md) before any further step. When a backend is configured (`rp`, `codex`, `copilot`, `cursor`, `claude`, `host`, `none`), ask nothing: flags win, depth defaults, review uses that backend. Show the hint:

```
(Tip: --depth=short|standard|deep, --review=rp|codex|copilot|cursor|claude|host|none)
```

## Workflow

Read [steps.md](steps.md) and follow each step in order. Its optional paths (readiness warning, Route A, tracker-first mint, tracker projection, review, next-steps menu) load their references only when the step's condition holds.

**Step 1 launches every scout in the depth-appropriate set, in ONE parallel Task call.** A plan whose research skipped a scout in its tier, or ran the set sequentially, has broken this.

## Output

- Spec: `.flow/specs/<spec-id>.json` + `.md`; tasks: `.flow/tasks/<spec-id>.M.json` + `.md`.
- No code changes and no plan files outside `.flow/`.
