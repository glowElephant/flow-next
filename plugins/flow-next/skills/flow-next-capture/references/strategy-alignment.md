## 0.3b — Strategy snapshot (advisory grounding input)

Read `STRATEGY.md` (when populated) so Phase 2's source-tagging can apply `[strategy:<track>]` to acceptance criteria that follow directly from strategic intent. Husk-vs-presence gate uses `sections_filled >= 1` from `flowctl strategy status --json`, NOT `[[ -f STRATEGY.md ]]`.

```bash
STRATEGY_STATUS_JSON=$("$FLOWCTL" strategy status --json 2>/dev/null || echo '{"exists":false,"sections_filled":0}')
STRATEGY_FILLED=$(jq -r '.sections_filled // 0' <<< "$STRATEGY_STATUS_JSON" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)

if [[ "$STRATEGY_FILLED" -ge 1 ]]; then
  STRATEGY_JSON=$("$FLOWCTL" strategy read --json 2>/dev/null || echo '{}')
  STRATEGY_PRESENT=true
  STRATEGY_NAME=$(jq -r '.name // "(unnamed)"' <<< "$STRATEGY_JSON")
  STRATEGY_PROBLEM=$(jq -r '.target_problem // ""' <<< "$STRATEGY_JSON")
  STRATEGY_APPROACH=$(jq -r '.approach // ""' <<< "$STRATEGY_JSON")
  STRATEGY_TRACKS_RAW=$(jq -r '.tracks // ""' <<< "$STRATEGY_JSON")
  STRATEGY_PATH=$(jq -r '.path // "STRATEGY.md"' <<< "$STRATEGY_JSON")
else
  STRATEGY_PRESENT=false
fi
```

Surface as a "Strategic context:" footnote — 3-5 lines total — when the agent presents Phase 0 results to the user. Format:

```
Strategic context (STRATEGY.md, last updated 2026-04-30):
  Approach: <verbatim approach line, capped to 1-2 sentences>
  Active tracks: <track-name-1>, <track-name-2>, <track-name-3>
```

`STRATEGY_TRACKS_RAW` is a **raw markdown string** with `### <track-name>` H3 sub-blocks. Parse the H3 names locally for the active-tracks list. Empty section bodies (any of `target_problem`, `approach`, `tracks`) surface as `""` — `(.field // "")` style fallbacks in the jq queries above keep parsing well-formed when an optional section is missing.

The strategy snapshot is **input**, not gating: even when `STRATEGY_PRESENT=true`, capture proceeds. Phase 2's source-tagging uses the snapshot to assign `[strategy:<track-name>]` to criteria that quote / paraphrase strategy content. Phase 5 uses it to detect contradictions (see §5.0 below) and refuse the write without `--override-strategy`.

When `STRATEGY_PRESENT=false`, Phase 2 emits no `[strategy:*]` tags and Phase 5's contradiction check is skipped entirely — there is no signal to align to.

## 5.0 — Strategy contradiction check (gate; runs before any write)

When the Phase 0 strategy snapshot was populated (`STRATEGY_PRESENT=true`), scan the drafted spec body for contradictions against the active tracks. A contradiction exists when:

1. The spec body has at least one `[strategy:<track>]` line AND the surrounding criterion / decision-context line negates the corresponding track body. Example: track `### CLI-only` says "we ship CLI tools, not SaaS"; spec criterion `[strategy:CLI-only]` reads "ship a managed dashboard service" — direct contradiction.
2. The spec body proposes an investment area that contradicts `approach` directly. Example: approach says "OSS-tools repo, no commercial SaaS"; spec body adds "stripe billing integration as a core feature" without `[strategy:*]` tagging — semantic contradiction even without a tag.

When a contradiction is detected AND `OVERRIDE_STRATEGY` is `0`:

```text
Error: spec contradicts active track "<track>" — pass --override-strategy to proceed.

Detected contradiction:
  Track: <track-name> (STRATEGY.md)
  Track says: "<canonical wording>"
  Spec says:  "<conflicting wording>"

Re-run with --override-strategy to write the spec anyway. You'll be prompted to
record the override as a decision entry (the override is exactly the kind of
load-bearing architectural choice the decisions track exists for).
```

In **interactive** mode, refuse with the message above (exit 2) — do NOT prompt the user to override here; require the explicit flag re-run so the override is intentional.

In **autofix** mode, refuse identically (exit 2). Autofix cannot resolve a strategy override.

With `OVERRIDE_STRATEGY=1` and a populated snapshot: read [strategy-override.md](strategy-override.md) for the write, the decision-entry prompt and the audit line.

When `STRATEGY_PRESENT=false`, this entire section is a no-op — there's no strategy snapshot to contradict.
