# /flow-next:capture workflow

Execute these phases in order; stop on a user-blocking error rather than continuing with bad state.

This file is the spine every run walks. Path-specific machinery (autofix, `--rewrite`, chart briefings, strategy, splits, glossary, readiness, tracker, must-ask detail) sits in `references/*.md` behind gates. When a gate sentinel prints, STOP and Read the named reference before the next step; when it is silent, read nothing.

## Preamble

```bash
set -e
FLOWCTL="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/scripts/flowctl"
[ -x "$FLOWCTL" ] || FLOWCTL="<plugin-root>/scripts/flowctl"   # <plugin-root> = the directory two levels above this skill's SKILL.md file (the harness gave you that file's absolute path when the skill loaded); substitute it literally
[ -x "$FLOWCTL" ] || FLOWCTL=".flow/bin/flowctl"
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
SPECS_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/.flow/specs"
TODAY="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)"
```

`jq` and `python3` must be on PATH. Mode and flags come from SKILL.md's mode detection. If `.flow/` does not exist, print `No .flow/ directory — run \`$FLOWCTL init\` first.` and exit cleanly.

Take ONE preflight snapshot for the run and derive every later gate from it with `jq`; no further `config get` for values it holds. Compose the literal path with an agent-chosen 4-char suffix and type it verbatim in later calls:

```bash
CAPTURE_CFG="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/flow-capture-config-<suffix>.json"   # literal path
"$FLOWCTL" preflight --json > "$CAPTURE_CFG" 2>/dev/null || { printf '{"key":null,"value":{}}' > "$CAPTURE_CFG"; echo "[CAPTURE]: config snapshot empty — flowctl unreachable; snapshot-derived gates degrade to defaults" >&2; }
```

---

## Phase 0: Pre-flight (R5, R6, R8)

Catch what makes capture unsafe before drafting: a duplicate spec, relevant evidence lost to compaction, an overwrite conflict.

### 0.2 — Duplicate detection

Pull up to 10 distinctive keywords from the user's turns (repeated proper nouns, file paths, multi-word domain phrases, quoted terms). Compare them against the titles of open specs (`status == "open"`) in `.flow/specs/*.json`; a done spec is shipped work, not a duplicate. Count **strong matches** (shared proper nouns, paths, or phrases, not common words): 0-1 is no conflict, 2 is a potential duplicate (`proceed-anyway` recommended), 3+ is likely (`extend` or `supersede` recommended). Record the matched ids and titles for §0.5. (Pre-1.0 `.flow/epics/` repos: port first per `flowctl usage`.)

Then run `"$FLOWCTL" memory search "<keyword>" --json --limit 5` for the top three keywords. Hits are advisory: list them as `Related context:` in the summary; they never trigger the duplicate branch. Skip silently when memory is not initialized.

### 0.3b — Strategy gate

```bash
ACTIVE=0
# NO pipelines in the probe — capture raw first, rc-checked; parse separately.
RAW="$(jq -ce 'if .probes.strategy.status == "ok" then .probes.strategy.value else error("strategy probe") end' "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/flow-capture-config-<suffix>.json" 2>/dev/null)" || ACTIVE=1     # probe ERROR ⇒ ACTIVE (fail open)
if [ "$ACTIVE" = "0" ]; then
  VAL="$(printf '%s' "$RAW" | jq -r '.sections_filled // 0' 2>/dev/null)" || ACTIVE=1   # parse ERROR ⇒ ACTIVE
  [ "${VAL:-0}" -ge 1 ] 2>/dev/null && ACTIVE=1
fi
if [ "$ACTIVE" = "1" ]; then
  echo "GATE ACTIVE — STOP. Read references/strategy-alignment.md before continuing."
fi   # default branch: bare no-op — NO link, NO read path
```

On the sentinel, read [references/strategy-alignment.md](references/strategy-alignment.md) and take its snapshot; it also owns the §5.0 contradiction check. Silent: no `[strategy:*]` tags and no §5.0.

### 0.4 — Compaction detection (R6)

Look for compaction signals: `[compacted]` markers, truncated tool output, system-summary blocks, or later turns relying on a result that is not visible. A signal alone is not a refusal. The question is whether evidence **relevant to this capture** is gone: proceed when the feature is fully stated in visible user turns (note `Prior compaction detected; relevant capture evidence remains visible.` in the summary warnings); treat it as incomplete when a relevant requirement is summary-only, truncated, or missing, or when the draft would have to guess. When unsure, treat it as incomplete.

If relevant evidence is incomplete AND `FROM_COMPACTED_OK` is `0`, refuse: name the markers and gaps, and tell the user to restate the missing requirements or re-run with `--from-compacted-ok` after checking the transcript holds the full intent. Interactive capture does not offer to proceed anyway; autofix exits 2.

### 0.5 — Duplicate branch

Silent overwrite is never an option (R8). With ≥2 strong matches and no `REWRITE_TARGET`: GATE ACTIVE — STOP. Read [references/duplicate-branch.md](references/duplicate-branch.md) and run its §0.5 branch (`extend` / `supersede` / `proceed-anyway` / `abort`; autofix exits 2) before drafting. When unsure whether matches are strong, treat the gate as active.

### 0.5b — Chart briefing gate

When the conversation or `$ARGUMENTS` names a chart briefing (a `.flow/charts/*-briefing*.md` path, a B-ID, or a chart id whose sidecar lists briefings): GATE ACTIVE — STOP and Read [references/chart-briefing.md](references/chart-briefing.md) before drafting. It owns admission (draft/stale fail closed; the risk override names the unresolved D-IDs), evidence extraction, the provenance-separation rule, and the `chart link-spec` handoff and its retry rules for Phase 5. Otherwise read nothing.

### 0.6 — Idempotency (R8)

- **`REWRITE_TARGET` set** → GATE ACTIVE — STOP. Read [references/rewrite-mode.md](references/rewrite-mode.md) and validate the target (an existing spec, not a task; otherwise exit 2). It also governs Phases 4-6 for the rewrite.
- **Otherwise**, if an earlier turn shows a prior capture (`Spec captured at .flow/specs/<id>.md`), run §0.6 in `references/duplicate-branch.md` (rewrite / proceed / abort; autofix exits 2).

---

## Phase 1: Extract conversation evidence (R3)

Build the evidence first; the draft cites it, not memory. It is always collected; whether it is written into the spec is the resolved template's call (§2.2).

### 1.1 — Verbatim user turns

For each user turn with spec content (goals, requirements, constraints, scope, rejected options, examples), emit `> user (turn <N>): "<verbatim text>"`, splitting long turns into verbatim parts. A chosen question option is `> user (turn <N>, selected): "<option label verbatim>"`. Only what the user typed counts: never agent narration, tool output, or capture's own process conclusions (a fabricated "This is a NEW spec. Do NOT mark ready." turn has broken this). Skip greetings and noise. Cap at ~30 lines; when older turns must go, open the block with `> [truncated: N earlier turns]`.

### 1.2 — Codebase verification (R12)

When the conversation references repo files or modules whose state matters for the spec (beyond one or two checked on the main thread): GATE ACTIVE — STOP. Read [references/codebase-verification.md](references/codebase-verification.md) and run its read-only investigation before drafting. A verified user-named component can be `[paraphrase]`; unverified ones stay `[inferred]`.

### 1.3 — Title

Draft the shortest noun phrase that names the goal (≤60 chars). A title the user never stated is inferred; Phase 3 case (a) fires only when several plausible titles compete.

---

## Phase 2: Source-tagged synthesis (R4, R14, R15)

Spec prose follows [docs/prose.md](../../docs/flow-next/prose.md) when present.

### 2.1 — Source tags

Tag only what capture authored: `[paraphrase]`, `[inferred]`, `[strategy:<track>]`. The user's verbatim words stay untagged and must be findable in the evidence. Meanings and examples: [phases.md](phases.md) §Source-tag taxonomy. When the chart gate fired, apply its provenance-separation rule (chart evidence is never tagged; existing criteria are never retagged).

### 2.2 — Apply the resolved template

The section structure comes from the canonical [`plugins/flow-next/templates/spec.md`](../../templates/spec.md) (R17: cross-link, never re-embed the list), resolved first-match from `<repo_root>/SPEC.md` → `<repo_root>/spec.md` → the bundled file. **The resolved template decides what goes in the spec:** write the sections it names as headings or in `auxiliary_sections`, in its order and positions, follow its instructions, and add no section it leaves out (the bundled entries put `Conversation Evidence` at the top and `Requirement coverage` at the end). A section with no conversation signal stays absent; empty beats fabricated.

- **`## Acceptance Criteria`** — `- **R1:** ...` prose bullets, allocated from R1 (fresh spec, no renumber concern). When `.flow/criteria.md` exists, never restate a G-ID as an R-ID; reference it in prose and write an R only for what this spec adds.
- **`## Requirement coverage`** — only when the template names it and the route is planned (`NO_PLAN_OPT=0`, and under `from:flow` §2.8 resolved to plan): each R-ID mapped to `fn-N.M (TBD - populate via /flow-next:plan)`. Omitted on the direct route, where work's single implicit task is the coverage. Capture writes no tasks.
- **`## Parked unknowns`** (optional) — only genuine fog, one bullet each, naming what would resolve it. Decidable now → decide it; resolvable by scheduled work → a task for plan; inferred fill-in stays tagged, not parked.

### 2.4 — Testability

Each criterion must let a reviewer point at behavior and say met or not. One that fails ("make it fast") triggers Phase 3 case (b). Count `[inferred]` lines for the summary.

### 2.5 — Spec-count gate (R11)

At 8+ criteria, or criteria serving more than one independently shippable outcome: GATE ACTIVE — STOP. Read [references/split-proposal.md](references/split-proposal.md) and decide 1 vs N specs (it owns the Phase 4 `split-as-proposed` choice, §5.2b, and the split close). Capture never auto-splits.

### 2.6 — Business context (R24)

Business context the user stated goes into the section that owns it: audience, problem and why-now, UX expectations, and framing constraints or risks into `Goal & Context`; MVP scope and non-goals into `Boundaries`; success measures into outcome criteria. Success measures, prioritization rationale, and constraints or risks that drive a trade-off also go under a `### Motivation` H3 in `## Decision Context`; without them Decision Context stays one flat body, and capture never writes `### Implementation Tradeoffs`. Routed content is the user's words or `[paraphrase]`, never `[inferred]`; a conversation with no business signal gains no business content.

### 2.7 — Glossary gate

```bash
ACTIVE=0
RAW="$(jq -ce 'if .probes.glossary.status == "ok" then .probes.glossary.value else error("glossary probe") end' "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/flow-capture-config-<suffix>.json" 2>/dev/null)" || ACTIVE=1     # probe ERROR ⇒ ACTIVE (fail open)
if [ "$ACTIVE" = "0" ]; then
  VAL="$(printf '%s' "$RAW" | jq -r '.total_terms // 0' 2>/dev/null)" || ACTIVE=1   # parse ERROR ⇒ ACTIVE
  [ "${VAL:-0}" -gt 0 ] 2>/dev/null && ACTIVE=1
fi
if [ "$ACTIVE" = "1" ]; then
  echo "GATE ACTIVE — STOP. Read references/glossary-terms.md before continuing."
fi   # default branch: bare no-op — NO link, NO read path
```

On the sentinel, read [references/glossary-terms.md](references/glossary-terms.md) and run its scan (it owns the §5.8 consent and write). Silent: no proposals.

### 2.8 — Route judgment

Once criteria are drafted, judge the spec once against [`plan-vs-no-plan.md`](../flow-next-flow/references/plan-vs-no-plan.md) (plus [`route-matrix.md`](../flow-next-flow/references/route-matrix.md) when product or authority questions or design risk remain). Record `ROUTE_DIRECT=1` or `0`. It feeds the coverage rule, the summary's `Recommended next:`, §5.9b, and Phase 6. Re-judge only when an edit changes the criteria.

---

## Phase 3: Must-ask cases (R9)

| Case | Trigger | Interactive | Autofix |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **(a) Ambiguous title** | Several plausible titles, none load-bearing | Pick from candidates or custom | exit 2 |
| **(b) Untestable acceptance** | §2.4 flagged a criterion | Per criterion: drop / reword / clarify | exit 2 |
| **(c) Scope-conflict** | After `supersede` or `proceed-anyway`, scope still overlaps the old spec | How to split the boundaries | exit 2 |

When any case fires: GATE ACTIVE — STOP. Read [references/must-ask-cases.md](references/must-ask-cases.md) for the question shape and autofix error text. Other `[inferred]` content is not asked about; it surfaces in the summary.

---

## Phase 4: Prepare the write

The interactive capture request authorizes saving once pre-flight and must-ask questions are resolved; do not ask for write approval. Autofix keeps its `--yes` gate.

### 4.1 — Materialize and check the body

Write the complete body once to `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/flow-capture-draft-<working-title-slug>-<4-char suffix>.md` and use that literal path in Phase 5; never re-author it in a heredoc. The body opens with its own `# <title>` (the write replaces the whole file, placeholder heading included). Before writing, check every untagged criterion, decision, and boundary line is findable in the evidence; retag a restatement `[paraphrase]` and an unsupported line `[inferred]`, then recompute the tally. If a split was proposed, settle it per [references/split-proposal.md](references/split-proposal.md); a rewrite follows [references/rewrite-mode.md](references/rewrite-mode.md).

### 4.2 — Snapshot readiness before writing

Readiness is a separate follow-up; capture the predicate now, before a rewrite resets the old flag. This step asks and writes nothing:

```bash
ACTIVE=0
# From the preamble root snapshot (same literal path) — not a config get call.
VAL="$(jq -r '.value.tracker.readyState // empty' "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/flow-capture-config-<suffix>.json" 2>/dev/null)" || ACTIVE=1
[ -z "$VAL" ] && ACTIVE=1
if [ "$ACTIVE" = "1" ]; then
  echo "GATE ACTIVE — STOP. Read references/mark-ready.md before continuing."
fi   # default branch: bare no-op — NO link, NO read path
```

On the sentinel, read [references/mark-ready.md](references/mark-ready.md), compute its §4.2 predicate, and keep it for §5.9. Silent: `tracker.readyState` owns readiness, so capture offers no readiness write.

### 4.3 — Editor and correction handling

Runs from §5.6a, on the saved spec (never the temporary draft). After an editor round, re-read the whole file before anything else and keep the user's edits; an edit is not approval to execute. A chat correction is appended verbatim to the evidence first (the spec's `## Conversation Evidence` when it has one, never adding the block otherwise; trim older lines with §1.1's marker, never the correction). Then edit only the affected sections through the normal write plumbing. After either kind of change, recheck findability, recompute the tally, re-judge the route if criteria changed, and run the applicable §5.0 strategy check (surface a new conflict rather than rolling back the user's file). Show only the diff and tally. There is no re-approval loop: `continue` or stopping leaves the spec as saved, deletion needs an explicit request, and a later capture still runs the duplicate/rewrite checks.

### 4.4 — Autofix write gate

Autofix follows [references/autofix-mode.md](references/autofix-mode.md): print the draft summary and write only with `--yes`; without it, exit 0 with the draft path and no spec allocated.

---

## Phase 5: Write via flowctl (R14, R15, R16)

### 5.0 — Strategy contradiction check

When §0.3b's gate fired, run §5.0 of `references/strategy-alignment.md` before any write (refuses a contradiction unless `--override-strategy`, and records the override).

### 5.2 — New-spec branch

The §4.1 draft file is the body; tags stay in it as the audit trail.

```bash
SPEC_TITLE="<chosen title from Phase 3 or Phase 1.3>"

# Tracker-first mint gate (distributed id allocation). Probe raw, rc-checked; parse separately.
ACTIVE=0
RAW="$(jq -ce 'if .probes.tracker.status == "ok" then .probes.tracker.value else error("tracker probe") end' "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/flow-capture-config-<suffix>.json" 2>/dev/null)" || ACTIVE=1     # probe ERROR ⇒ ACTIVE (fail open)
if [ "$ACTIVE" = "0" ]; then
  VAL="$(printf '%s' "$RAW" | jq -r '.active' 2>/dev/null)" || ACTIVE=1   # parse ERROR ⇒ ACTIVE
  [ "$VAL" = "true" ] && ACTIVE=1
fi
if [ "$ACTIVE" = "1" ]; then
  echo "GATE ACTIVE — STOP. Read references/tracker-integration.md before continuing."
fi   # default branch: bare no-op — NO link, NO read path

# SILENT degrade - the ONLY flow-first creation site, deliberately an
# unconditional post-check outside the tracker-first branch (rationale + the
# orphan-issue GUARD live in references/tracker-integration.md §5.2).
# Type the literal draft path verbatim (never a shell variable across prompt turns).
if [ -z "$SPEC_OUTPUT" ] && [ -z "$IDENTIFIER" ]; then
  SPEC_OUTPUT=$("$FLOWCTL" spec create --title "$SPEC_TITLE" --plan-file "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/flow-capture-draft-<working-title-slug>-<suffix>.md" --json)
fi
SPEC_ID=$(printf '%s' "$SPEC_OUTPUT" | jq -r '.id')

if [[ -z "$SPEC_ID" || "$SPEC_ID" == "null" ]]; then
  echo "Error: spec create failed: $SPEC_OUTPUT" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Run anchor for Phase 6's sync check — written BEFORE the 5.7 dispatch.
date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ > "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/flow-capture-anchor-${SPEC_ID}"
```

On the tracker sentinel, read [references/tracker-integration.md](references/tracker-integration.md) and run its §5.2 tracker-first mint (and later its §5.7 touchpoint). Silent: `spec create` mints locally and nothing tracker-related runs. `spec create` leaves nothing behind on failure; report the error and exit 1. When the chart gate fired, run its §5.2 `chart link-spec` handoff only after a successful create.

### 5.2b — Split branch

Only after `split-as-proposed`: `references/split-proposal.md` §5.2b (all N bodies, §5.2 per spec in dependency order, `spec add-dep` per edge). Autofix never reaches it.

### 5.3 — Rewrite branch

Only with `REWRITE_TARGET`: `references/rewrite-mode.md` §5.3 (`set-plan` over the existing body, idempotent `spec unready`, run anchor).

### 5.4 — Branch name

If the user named a feature branch, run `"$FLOWCTL" spec set-branch "$SPEC_ID" --branch "<slug>" --json`; otherwise the spec id default stands.

### 5.6a — Saved-spec review (interactive only)

Read [docs/read-back.md](../../docs/flow-next/read-back.md) for the summary shape: title, criteria count, source tally, warnings, related memory context, recommended route, and the saved path (plus the rewrite diff; one summary per spec for a split). The full body prints only on request.

**Ask the user via plain text.** Render the options below as a numbered list `1.` … `N.`, followed by a final option `N+1. Other — type your own answer`. Print the question, then the numbered list, then **stop and wait for the user's next message before continuing**. Parse the reply as: a bare number `1`–`N+1` → that option; the literal text of an option label → that option; free text after `Other` → custom answer.

Then use `plain-text numbered prompt` for one short editor question: `open in editor` opens the saved file(s); `continue` leaves them as written; free text is a correction. Apply §4.3 to either, then continue the remaining follow-ups without re-approval. Skip an offer already answered, and honor a request to review later. Saving or viewing grants no readiness, implementation, commit, or external-write authority; configured tracker behavior keeps its own scope.

### 5.7 — Tracker sync touchpoint

Only when §5.2's tracker gate fired: `references/tracker-integration.md` §5.7 (best-effort, `--event capture` receipt).

### 5.8 — Glossary term-adds (interactive only)

With glossary proposals, ask the separate `Glossary?` question in [references/glossary-terms.md](references/glossary-terms.md) unless already answered, and write only consented terms. Autofix never writes terms.

### 5.9 — Mark-ready write (interactive only)

With an eligible §4.2 snapshot, offer the separate `Mark ready?` question per [references/mark-ready.md](references/mark-ready.md) unless already answered: `mark-ready` writes, `keep-draft` leaves readiness unchanged. Autofix never writes readiness. Under `from:flow` the question is never asked: the conductor builds the spec in this session, so readiness does not matter and the spec stays as it is.

### 5.9b — No-plan write

Runs only on `NO_PLAN_OPT=1` (`--no-plan`, interactive or autofix) or `FROM_FLOW=1` with `ROUTE_DIRECT=1`. A user invocation without the flag never sets the field, whatever §2.8 judged.

```bash
# Capture raw first, rc-checked; parse separately so a non-task failure keeps its real reason.
if ! NO_PLAN_OUT="$("$FLOWCTL" spec set-no-plan "$SPEC_ID" --json 2>&1)"; then
  NO_PLAN_REASON="$(printf '%s' "$NO_PLAN_OUT" | jq -r '.error // empty' 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
  [ -z "$NO_PLAN_REASON" ] && NO_PLAN_REASON="$(printf '%s' "$NO_PLAN_OUT" | head -1)"
  echo "no_plan not set: ${NO_PLAN_REASON:-unknown error} — field left unchanged"
fi
```

Best-effort: a refusal (the spec already has tasks, reachable only on a `--rewrite` of a planned spec) prints that notice and the run continues.

### 5.10 — HTML render lens (opt-in)

```bash
ACTIVE=0
# From the preamble root snapshot (same literal path) — not a config get call.
VAL="$(jq -r 'if .value.artifacts.html.enabled == true then "true" else "false" end' "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/flow-capture-config-<suffix>.json" 2>/dev/null)" || ACTIVE=1   # parse ERROR ⇒ ACTIVE (fail open)
[ "$VAL" = "true" ] && ACTIVE=1
if [ "$ACTIVE" = "1" ]; then
  echo "GATE ACTIVE — STOP. Read references/html-lens.md before continuing."
fi   # default branch: bare no-op — NO link, NO read path
```

On the sentinel, follow [references/html-lens.md](references/html-lens.md). Silent: no artifact, no output.

---

## Phase 6: Close (R16)

**Tracker-sync check first** (read-only, independent of §5.7, so a skipped touchpoint is still caught):

```bash
# --since: the Phase-5 run anchor. created_at is a valid fallback only for a fresh
# capture; a rewrite needs the anchor (created_at would admit an old receipt).
ANCHOR_FILE="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/flow-capture-anchor-${SPEC_ID}"
if [[ -f "$ANCHOR_FILE" ]]; then
  SINCE="$(cat "$ANCHOR_FILE")"
else
  SINCE="$("$FLOWCTL" show "$SPEC_ID" --json | jq -r '.created_at')"
fi

"$FLOWCTL" sync check "$SPEC_ID" --events capture --since "$SINCE" --json
# Empty output → bridge inactive → no Tracker sync line. `.missing` empty → OK;
# non-empty → retro-fire (below).
```

When `.missing` is non-empty, run `references/tracker-integration.md` § Phase 6 once (never blocking) and record the final state.

Then print:

```text
Spec captured at .flow/specs/<SPEC_ID>.md.
Tracker sync: <OK | MISSING:capture → retro-fired → OK | MISSING:capture (retro-fire failed: <reason>)>
Recommended next: <the §2.8 judgment, in plan-vs-no-plan.md's shape>
```

- `Tracker sync:` prints only when the bridge is active.
- `Recommended next:` is mandatory unless `/flow-next:flow` dispatched the run: the §2.8 line from [`plan-vs-no-plan.md`](../flow-next-flow/references/plan-vs-no-plan.md) with the spec id filled in, in this host's command spelling (route-matrix.md's host command form). It is a recommendation, never a readiness write or permission to execute. Under `from:flow`, omit it: the conductor's stop report owns the next step.
- Gate-owned lines follow only when their step ran: `Glossary: added N term(s) (…)` (§5.8), `Readiness: marked ready` (§5.9), `No-plan: field set (flow --auto/work take the direct route)` or the refusal notice (§5.9b), `Artifact: .flow/artifacts/<SPEC_ID>/spec.html (render lens - regenerable; markdown is the record)` (§5.10).

A rewrite and a split change the first line and repeat the block per spec; `references/rewrite-mode.md` and `references/split-proposal.md` own those variants.
